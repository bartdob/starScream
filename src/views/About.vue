      This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata
      so that it can be repurposed for other applications.
      In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True,
      then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned.
      These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds;
      but generally help with discoverability
      of relevant imagery.</p>
